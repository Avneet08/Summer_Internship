 <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
 an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
 of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
 the other scientific journals her work had
 appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <strong>On
 The Road. </strong>On
 The Road. It had been Molly's favorite book
 since college, and the longer she spent in these
 four walls the more she felt she needed to be
 free.</p>
 <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
 sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
 proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
 people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
 many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
 the secrets of the llama <abbr
 title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
 outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
 she had something better to do.</p>
